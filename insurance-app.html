                     <p class="project-text">
                        DAVE is a legacy warranty and insurance application. It allows dealers and its users to buy and sell warranty 
                        products. Though DAVE was a stable product for many years, it began to lose its market edge. The goal of this 
                        project was to not just redesign the parts that work but to reimagine the product as a whole and create anew.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        At Sam-Tech I was tasked to build native UX practises, lead workshops, gather requirements, build scalable design systems. 
                        I had the opportunity to leverage my development skills making design handoffs efficient. I lead a small team of designers, 
                        researchers and technologists setting goals and through collaboration, reaching them.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        This particular project was a key deliverable during my time at Sym-Tech. It's a Warranty and Insurance Sales Application 
                        designed for several corporate users, including VW and Audi Canada. The project timeline was short, roughly 9 months, not 
                        just for design and development, but rather the goal for production release, so the design process was limited and required 
                        creativity to work around an 8 - 12 week time frame. But we did and it was a satisfying success!

                        Worked with key stakeholders to document business requirement documents, define use cases, and create user personas. 
                        This is also a great opportunity to build expectations with the teams, as this was an interdisciplinary project.

                        We conducted a detailed analysis of competitors and similar applications and built user guidelines. When problems would 
                        arise, as they typically do, I used a lean design thinking methodology.

                        With the help of design thinking, we brainstormed and gathered ideas, built skeleton wireframes, evaluated and analyzed. 
                        We built a scalable design system, through an iterative process hifi prototypes and built UX guidelines. We also leveraged 
                        several usability testing techniques like card sorting to prioritize features.

                        We assisted the Front-end team in developing the UI. The main task/goal was to build a scalable and reusable component
