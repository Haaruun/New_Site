                     <p class="project-text">
                        DAVE is a legacy warranty and insurance application. It allows dealers and its users to buy and sell warranty 
                        products. Though DAVE was a stable product for many years, it began to lose its market edge. The goal of this 
                        project was to not just redesign the parts that work but to reimagine the product as a whole.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        At Sam-Tech, I was tasked to build native ux practises, lead workshops, gather requirements, build a scalable design system, and 
                        more. I had the opportunity to leverage my development skills making design handoffs efficient. I lead a small team of designers, 
                        researchers and technologists setting goals and through collaboration, reaching them.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        This particular project was a key deliverable during my time at Sym-Tech. It's a Warranty and Insurance Sales Application 
                        designed for several corporate users, including VW and Audi Canada. The project timeline was short, roughly 9 months to 
						design, develop, test, and ultimately release to production. So the design process was limited and required creativity to 
						work around an 8 - 12 week time frame. But we did and it was a satisfying success!
                     </p>
                     <h2 class="project-subtitle">My Role</h2>
                     <p class="project-copy">
                        My role was to gather requirements, lead the design, and collaborate with developers, product managers and more. This included the
						following:

                        <b>Understanding & Requirments' Gathering</b> <br>
                        Worked with key stakeholders to document business requirements, define use cases, and create user personas. 
                     </p>

                        <b>Design Thinking & Research</b> <br>
						Design thinking played a crucial role in this project, especially in problem-solving. When problems would arise, as they 
						typically do, we used design thinking to empathize, define the problem, and more – to come to effective solutions. Usability
						testing techniques like card sorting and other research methods like user interviews were crucial in providing context and
						insight.

                     <p class="project-copy"> 
                        <b>Implementation</b> <br>
                        Assisted the development team in developing the UI. The main task/goal was to build a scalable and reusable component 
                        library using React, JavaScript and HTML/CSS.

                        at the closest competitors, providing similar products and services, at a similar scale. We analyzed our competitors to 
						break down their strengths and weaknesses to reveal potential opportunities.

                        Our define phase followed, and it included the creation of multiple user personas, empathy maps, and user journey maps.

                        <b><i>Empathy Mapping:</i></b> <br>
                        We used empathy maps to get a better understanding of our users, their decision-making tendencies and overall behaviours. 
                        It made it easier to make actionable decisions regarding our users and their needs.

                        <b>Ideation Phase</b> <br>
                        The ideation phase was critical in organizing all of the results from our previous phases. It included the creation 
                        of user flows, card sorting and how might we statements.

                        After resolving early problems and constraints, we narrowed down our users and their needs and followed this by plotting 
                        out the user flow. Here is one scenario:

                        <b>Design Phase</b> <br>
                        Our design process was crucial in visualizing all previous steps. It included sketching, wireframes, building a scalable design 
                        system and iterative prototypes.

                        After wireframes were reviewed and approved we began designing the prototypes using Adobe XD. Here are some of the

                        <b>Testing & Development Handoff</b> <br>
                        The project didn’t have a large UI development team, and as such, I was able to leverage my skills to support and collaborate with the 
                        UI developers in reaching development and production targets. My contributions included building a scalable UI component library 
						using React, HTML, CSS, and more.

                        <br>
                        Accessibility played a major role in our design process, and in development, we used WAVE to evaluate our output.
