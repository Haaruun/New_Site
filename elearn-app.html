                     My main focus at ICTC is to build internal design and UX practises and support internal and external facing products and applications. 
                     As one of the main focuses of ICTC advancing Canada's digital economy, investment in education and access to education and tools plays 
                     a key role in the organization's goals. As such, one of the main projects I was tasked with was designing a light e-Learning 
                     application to address gaps in the market for newcomers.

                     <p class="project-copy">
                        For many Canadians and Newcomers, it can be difficult to keep up-to-date and learn new skills. Friction and pain points 
                        resulting from language barriers and access result in people across Canada being left out of accessing important resources.
                        <br>

                        An E-Learning Application that allows users from across the country, with a specific focus on newcomers, minorities and people 
                        with disabilities that provides access to people across Canada to learning opportunities.

                        <b>Discovery Phase</b> <br>
                        We began with the discovery phase to establish the base for the project. This included stakeholder interviews, user interviews, 
                        qualitative and quantitative analysis. It also included a broad competitive analysis.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b><i>Competitive Analysis</i></b> <br>
                        We conducted a light analysis of competitors and services providers who operate in the space, though typically with different 
                        objectives and goals. This provided important insights and illuminated our potential direction.

                        <b>Define Phase</b> <br>
                        After discovery, we defined our results and leveraged stakeholder input. Our define phase included the 
                        creation of user personas, empathy mapping and user journey maps.

                        <b><i>User Personas:</i></b> <br>
                        Two user personas were created based on the research gathered during our discovery phase. The characters, though fictional, provide great 
                        content for our architecture, design and overthinking.

                        <b>Ideation Phase</b> <br>
                        Our focus during the ideation phase was to test and realize the results of the discovery and define phases. We leveraged 
                        many problem-solving techniques and worked on Card Sorting, Information Architecture, and workshopping ideas.

                        <b><i>Information Architecture:</i></b> <br>
                        Due to time constraints, we didn’t have the ideal amount of time for IA, but our goal was to leverage the time we did have 
                        to build a minimal and simple IA.

                        <b>Design Phase</b> <br>
                        After the crucial research, stakeholder input and findings, we began the design phase with rough sketches of the application. 
                        The design phase also included Wireframes, building a Light Design System and iteratively improved prototypes.

                        <b><i>Medium Fidelity Prototypes:</i></b> <br>
                        We finally built mockups based on the insights from previous steps and research. This was an iterative process. The goal 
                        was simplicity and accessibility and we made the effort to reflect that in our final design. The following are excerpts 
                        of the medium-fidelity designs:

                        <b>Testing and Development Handoff</b> <br>
                        We were able to get feedback from a plurality of users using an interactive version of our prototype we built using HTML, 
                        CSS, and JavaScript on a staging server. This allowed us to get tangible feedback on what worked and what didn’t. We were 
                        able to leverage our technical skillset to work with the development team to make the handoff smooth, efficient and productive.
